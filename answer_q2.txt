Q2: What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
Blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...).

A2: When blending is performed with different image filter sizes, the images in each pyramid layers have different intensities.
That means that smaller filter size will result in layers with higher intensities. The merge of each layer will then be more rigid, 
because we are merging higher frequency layers. On the opposite, if the layers will have lower intensities, which will result in a smoother 
transition between the 2 images.
