Q3: What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
Blending is performed with a varying number of pyramid levels (max_levels = 1,2,3,4,5,...).

A3: When we're blending the 2 images with more levels in the pyramid, the blending will happen in
each level of the pyramid, resulting the a more 'smooth' edges of the mask. On the other hand, if the pyramid
has less layers in it, the blending will be more rigid and the edges of the mask will be more visible.
